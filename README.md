# Arc-Colora Theme

The goal is to make scripts that make it easy to change the 'accent' colours of the Arc-Theme.

This may also work on other Debian distributions since Linux Mint is debian based.

You may have to rename some of the applications depending on the distribution you are running.

## Arc COLORA is capable to have ANY colour YOU like.

Many youtube tutorials can be found in the channel of Mr. Erik Dubois. Have a look at the [Arc Theme - how to change the colours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlloYVGq5pS6V7a-66KRxHoXDIbeQBmNZ) playlist.


Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and various desktop shells, window managers and applications. It's well suited for GTK based desktop environments such as GNOME, Cinnamon, Xfce, Unity, MATE, Budgie etc.

The theme was originally designed and developed by [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), but the project has been unmaintained since May 2017.

The fork of [jnsh](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme) aims to keep the theme updated with new toolkit and desktop environment versions, resolve pre-existing issues, and improve and polish the theme while preserving the original visual design.
